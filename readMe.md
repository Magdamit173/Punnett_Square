# 🧬 Punnett Square Generator

A modern, interactive Punnett square visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Supports multi-allele traits, dynamic grid generation, and genotype frequency analysis — all in a clean, responsive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports any number of traits
- ✅ Multi-allele support (e.g. ABO blood types)
- ✅ Dynamic Punnett square generation
- ✅ Genotype frequency table
- ✅ Responsive and modern UI
- ✅ Clean, readable codebase

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Enter genotypes for both parents (e.g. `RrYy` and `RrYy`)
4. View the generated Punnett square and frequency table

## 🧪 Example Inputs

| Parent 1 | Parent 2 | Alleles per Trait | Traits |
|----------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `RrYy`   | `RrYy`   | 2                 | 2      |
| `AABBOO` | `AABBOO` | 3                 | 2      |

> ⚠️ Both parents must have the same number of traits.  
> Allele count must be divisible by the number of alleles per trait.

## 📊 Future Ideas

- [ ] Phenotype prediction
- [ ] Dominant/recessive coloring
- [ ] Export to CSV
- [ ] Pie chart visualization
- [ ] Dark mode toggle

## 🕰️ Legacy Note

This project is a spiritual successor to an earlier version from **Feb 11, 2024**.  
That one was... ambitious. This one is clean, fast, and actually works.  
Welcome back, fast self. You did good. 💪
